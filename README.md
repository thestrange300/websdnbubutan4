<h1 align="center" style="color: #0366d6;">Web Design of SDN Bubutan IV</h1>

<p align="center" style="color: #586069;">A modern and responsive web platform built using Laravel and Tailwind CSS.</p>

<h2 style="color: #24292e;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="color: #24292e;">This repository is a school company profile website built using Laravel and Tailwind CSS. Laravel is a PHP framework that provides a robust and secure platform for web development. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic, user interface, and data. This separation ensures code organization, maintainability, and scalability of web applications. Laravel also has built-in security features such as SQL injection prevention, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, and encryption. </p>

<p style="color: #24292e;">Tailwind CSS is a modern CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes to make styling easier and more consistent. It follows a utility-first approach, which means that every CSS class has a specific purpose and can be reused throughout the project. This approach helps reduce the amount of custom CSS code and speeds up development time. Tailwind CSS also has responsive design utilities, which allow developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>

<p style="color: #24292e;">The website showcases the school's history, mission, and achievements, as well as providing information on its programs, staff, and resources. The site is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, allowing users to easily access the information they need on any device. This design is achieved by utilizing responsive design principles, such as flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries, to adjust the layout and content to fit different screen sizes. The website is also optimized for accessibility, adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards, ensuring that all users can access and interact with the content.</p>
